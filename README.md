## Installation and Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher) or yarn
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sunmughan/quote2.git
cd quote2

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 (as configured in vite.config.js)

### Building for Production

```bash
# Create a production build
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the production-ready files. Note: The `dist` folder is not included in the repository as it's generated during the build process and is listed in the .gitignore file.

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploying to cPanel Hosting

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Upload to cPanel**:
   - Log in to your cPanel account
   - Navigate to File Manager
   - Go to the public_html directory (or a subdirectory where you want to host the app)
   - Upload all files from the `dist` folder

3. **Configure .htaccess**:
   Create or edit the .htaccess file in your hosting directory with the following content:
   ```
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteBase /
     RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
     RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   </IfModule>
   ```

4. **Set up SSL** (recommended):
   - Go to the SSL/TLS section in cPanel
   - Install an SSL certificate if you don't have one
   - Enable HTTPS redirection

   [build]
     publish = "dist"
     command = "npm run build"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blank page after deployment**:
   - Check if your server is configured to handle SPA routing
   - Ensure all files were uploaded correctly
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **404 errors when refreshing pages**:
   - Configure your server to redirect all requests to index.html
   - Check your .htaccess, nginx.conf, or server configuration

3. **API calls not working**:
   - This application uses localStorage and doesn't require a backend API
   - If you've added a backend, ensure CORS is configured correctly

4. **Images or assets not loading**:
   - Check if paths are correct
   - Ensure all assets were included in the build
